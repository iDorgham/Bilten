# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) that document significant architectural decisions made during the development of the Bilten platform.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records are documents that capture important architectural decisions made during a project. They provide context for why certain decisions were made, what alternatives were considered, and the consequences of those decisions.

## ADR Structure

Each ADR follows this structure:

### Header
- **Title**: Clear, descriptive title
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
- **Date**: When the decision was made
- **Deciders**: Who made the decision

### Content
- **Context**: What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?
- **Decision**: What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?
- **Consequences**: What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?

## ADR List

### Accepted ADRs
- [ADR-001: Microservices Architecture](001-microservices-architecture.md) - Adopted microservices over monolithic architecture
- [ADR-002: PostgreSQL as Primary Database](002-postgresql-database.md) - Chose PostgreSQL over other database options
- [ADR-003: React Frontend Framework](003-react-frontend.md) - Selected React for frontend development
- [ADR-004: JWT Authentication](004-jwt-authentication.md) - Implemented JWT-based authentication
- [ADR-005: Redis Caching Strategy](005-redis-caching.md) - Adopted Redis for caching layer
- [ADR-006: Docker Containerization](006-docker-containerization.md) - Containerized application deployment
- [ADR-007: API Gateway Pattern](007-api-gateway.md) - Implemented API gateway for service communication
- [ADR-008: Event-Driven Architecture](008-event-driven-architecture.md) - Adopted event-driven communication patterns

### Proposed ADRs
- [ADR-009: GraphQL Implementation](009-graphql-implementation.md) - Consider GraphQL for complex data queries
- [ADR-010: Serverless Functions](010-serverless-functions.md) - Evaluate serverless for specific use cases

### Deprecated ADRs
- [ADR-011: Monolithic Architecture](011-monolithic-architecture.md) - Superseded by ADR-001

## ADR Workflow

### Creating a New ADR

1. **Identify the Decision**: Determine if the decision warrants an ADR
2. **Create the ADR**: Use the template and create a new ADR file
3. **Review Process**: Submit for team review and discussion
4. **Decision**: Accept, reject, or modify the ADR
5. **Implementation**: Follow the accepted ADR in development

### ADR Template

```markdown
# [ADR-XXX]: [Title]

## Status
[Proposed/Accepted/Deprecated/Superseded]

## Date
[YYYY-MM-DD]

## Deciders
[List of people who made the decision]

## Context
[What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?]

## Decision
[What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?]

## Consequences
[What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?]

## Alternatives Considered
[List of alternatives that were considered]

## Implementation Notes
[Any notes about implementation]

## References
[Links to relevant documentation, discussions, etc.]
```

## ADR Guidelines

### When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR when the decision:
- Affects the overall system architecture
- Has long-term consequences
- Involves significant technical debt
- Changes how teams work together
- Affects performance, security, or scalability

### When NOT to Create an ADR

Don't create an ADR for:
- Implementation details
- Temporary decisions
- Minor refactoring
- Tool choices that don't affect architecture

### ADR Maintenance

- **Regular Review**: Review ADRs periodically for relevance
- **Update Status**: Update status when decisions change
- **Link Implementation**: Link ADRs to actual implementation
- **Archive**: Archive deprecated ADRs for historical reference

## ADR Best Practices

### Writing Good ADRs

1. **Be Specific**: Clearly state what was decided and why
2. **Include Context**: Explain the problem being solved
3. **Consider Alternatives**: Document what other options were considered
4. **Document Consequences**: Explain both positive and negative impacts
5. **Keep it Concise**: Focus on the decision, not implementation details

### ADR Review Process

1. **Technical Review**: Review by technical team members
2. **Architecture Review**: Review by architecture team
3. **Stakeholder Review**: Review by relevant stakeholders
4. **Final Decision**: Make final decision and update status

### ADR Communication

- **Team Awareness**: Ensure team is aware of new ADRs
- **Documentation**: Link ADRs to relevant documentation
- **Training**: Include ADRs in onboarding materials
- **Updates**: Communicate when ADRs are updated or deprecated
