# ADR-001: Microservices Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Date

## Deciders
Architecture Team, Technical Lead, CTO

## Context

The Bilten platform needs to handle multiple user types (end users, event organizers, platform admins, QR scanners) with different requirements and scaling needs. The initial monolithic architecture was becoming difficult to maintain and scale as the platform grew.

Key challenges with the monolithic approach:
- Single point of failure for all services
- Difficult to scale individual components
- Technology lock-in for the entire application
- Long deployment cycles
- Complex testing and debugging
- Team coordination issues during development

## Decision

We will adopt a microservices architecture for the Bilten platform, breaking down the monolithic application into smaller, focused services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

### Service Breakdown

1. **User Service** - User management, authentication, profiles
2. **Event Service** - Event creation, management, discovery
3. **Ticket Service** - Ticket generation, validation, management
4. **Payment Service** - Payment processing, financial transactions
5. **Notification Service** - Email, SMS, push notifications
6. **Analytics Service** - Data analysis, reporting, insights
7. **Media Service** - File upload, storage, CDN management
8. **API Gateway** - Central entry point, authentication, routing

### Communication Patterns

- **Synchronous**: REST APIs for direct service-to-service communication
- **Asynchronous**: Event-driven communication using message queues
- **API Gateway**: Centralized routing and authentication

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- **Independent Deployment**: Each service can be deployed independently
- **Technology Diversity**: Different services can use different technologies
- **Scalability**: Services can be scaled independently based on demand
- **Fault Isolation**: Failure in one service doesn't affect others
- **Team Autonomy**: Teams can work on services independently
- **Performance**: Services can be optimized individually

### Negative Consequences

- **Complexity**: Increased operational complexity
- **Network Overhead**: Service-to-service communication overhead
- **Data Consistency**: Distributed data management challenges
- **Testing Complexity**: More complex integration testing
- **Monitoring**: More complex monitoring and debugging
- **Deployment Complexity**: More complex deployment orchestration

### Mitigation Strategies

- **Service Mesh**: Implement service mesh for communication management
- **Event Sourcing**: Use event sourcing for data consistency
- **Distributed Tracing**: Implement comprehensive tracing
- **Automated Testing**: Comprehensive automated testing strategy
- **Monitoring**: Centralized monitoring and alerting

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Monolithic Architecture
- **Pros**: Simpler development, deployment, and testing
- **Cons**: Single point of failure, difficult scaling, technology lock-in
- **Decision**: Rejected due to scalability and maintainability concerns

### 2. Modular Monolith
- **Pros**: Better organization than monolith, easier than microservices
- **Cons**: Still single deployment unit, limited technology diversity
- **Decision**: Rejected as intermediate step, not solving core issues

### 3. Event-Driven Architecture
- **Pros**: Loose coupling, scalability, fault tolerance
- **Cons**: Complex debugging, eventual consistency
- **Decision**: Adopted as communication pattern within microservices

### 4. Serverless Architecture
- **Pros**: Auto-scaling, pay-per-use, reduced operational overhead
- **Cons**: Cold start latency, vendor lock-in, limited control
- **Decision**: Considered for specific services, not entire platform

## Implementation Notes

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Implement API Gateway
- Create core services (User, Event, Ticket)
- Set up service communication patterns

### Phase 2: Expansion
- Add remaining services (Payment, Notification, Analytics)
- Implement event-driven communication
- Set up monitoring and observability

### Phase 3: Optimization
- Performance optimization
- Advanced monitoring and alerting
- Service mesh implementation

### Technology Stack
- **API Gateway**: Kong, AWS API Gateway, or custom solution
- **Service Communication**: REST APIs, gRPC, message queues
- **Event Streaming**: Apache Kafka, AWS SQS/SNS
- **Service Discovery**: Consul, Eureka, or cloud-native solutions
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, distributed tracing
