- **High-Level System Overview** - Complete system architecture
- **Service Interaction Diagrams** - How services communicate
- **Data Flow Diagrams** - Information movement through the system

### Component Diagrams
- **Component Hierarchy** - Component relationships and dependencies
- **Service Boundaries** - Clear service separation and interfaces
- **Module Dependencies** - Internal component dependencies

### Data Architecture Diagrams
- **Database Schema** - Entity relationships and data models

## 🔄 Diagram Maintenance

### Version Control
- All diagrams should be version controlled
- Use text-based formats when possible
- Include source files for image-based diagrams

### Updates
- Update diagrams when architecture changes
- Maintain consistency across all diagram types
- Review diagrams during architecture reviews

### Standards
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Follow color coding standards
- Include legends and explanations
- Keep diagrams simple and readable

## 🛠️ Creating New Diagrams

### Guidelines
1. **Choose the right format** - Use Mermaid for simple diagrams, PlantUML for complex UML
2. **Keep it simple** - Focus on key relationships and flows
3. **Use consistent styling** - Follow established color and shape conventions
4. **Include context** - Add descriptions and explanations
5. **Update documentation** - Reference diagrams in relevant documentation
