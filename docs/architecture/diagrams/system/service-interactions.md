# Service Interaction Diagram

This diagram shows how different services interact and communicate within the Bilten platform, including both synchronous and asynchronous communication patterns.

## Service Communication Patterns

### 1. **Synchronous Communication**
- **Direct API Calls**: Services communicate directly via REST APIs
- **Request-Response**: Immediate response required
- **Error Handling**: Synchronous error propagation

### 2. **Asynchronous Communication**
- **Event-Driven**: Services communicate via message queues
- **Fire-and-Forget**: Non-blocking operations
- **Event Sourcing**: Track all state changes

### 3. **Caching Strategy**
- **Redis Cache**: Frequently accessed data
- **CDN**: Static assets and media files
- **Application Cache**: Service-level caching

## Service Dependencies

### Core Services
- **User Service**: Authentication, user management
- **Event Service**: Event creation, management
- **Ticket Service**: Ticket generation, validation

### Supporting Services
- **Payment Service**: Financial transactions
- **Notification Service**: Communication
- **Analytics Service**: Data analysis
- **Media Service**: File management

### Infrastructure Services
- **API Gateway**: Central entry point
- **Message Queue**: Event processing
- **Cache**: Performance optimization
- **Database**: Data persistence

## Error Handling Patterns

### Circuit Breaker Pattern
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Service A] --> B[Circuit Breaker]
    B --> C[Service B]
    B --> D[Fallback Response]
    
    style B fill:#ff9999
    style D fill:#99ff99
```

### Retry Pattern
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Request] --> B[Service]
    B --> C{Success?}
    C -->|No| D[Retry Logic]
    D --> B
    C -->|Yes| E[Response]
    
    style D fill:#ffff99
```

## Performance Considerations

### Load Balancing
- **Round Robin**: Distribute requests evenly
- **Least Connections**: Route to least busy service
- **Health Checks**: Monitor service health

### Caching Strategy
- **L1 Cache**: Application memory
- **L2 Cache**: Redis distributed cache
- **L3 Cache**: CDN for static content

### Database Optimization
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient database connections
- **Read Replicas**: Distribute read load
- **Query Optimization**: Indexed queries
