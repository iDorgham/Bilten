# API Gateway Service

## 📋 Overview

The API Gateway serves as the single entry point for all client applications to access Bilten platform services. It handles request routing, authentication, rate limiting, and provides a unified API interface.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Provide a unified API entry point for all services
- Handle authentication and authorization
- Implement rate limiting and throttling
- Route requests to appropriate backend services
- Provide API versioning and backward compatibility

## 🏗️ Architecture Components

### Request Router
- **Purpose**: Route incoming requests to appropriate services
- **Features**: Path-based routing, service discovery, load balancing
- **Use Cases**: API endpoint routing, microservice communication

### Authentication Middleware
- **Purpose**: Validate and authenticate API requests
- **Features**: JWT validation, API key management, OAuth integration
- **Use Cases**: User authentication, third-party API access

### Rate Limiting
- **Purpose**: Control API usage and prevent abuse
- **Features**: Per-user limits, burst protection, quota management
- **Use Cases**: API abuse prevention, fair usage enforcement

### Request/Response Transformation
- **Purpose**: Transform requests and responses as needed
- **Features**: Data transformation, format conversion, caching
- **Use Cases**: API versioning, response optimization, caching

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Review the [design document](design.md) for architecture details
2. Check [requirements](requirements.md) for specific needs
3. Follow [implementation tasks](tasks.md) for development
4. Set up routing rules and service discovery
5. Configure authentication and rate limiting

## 📊 Key Metrics

- API request volume and response times
- Rate limiting effectiveness
- Authentication success/failure rates
- Service availability and uptime
- Error rates and error types

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- API key management and rotation
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Request validation and sanitization
- CORS policy enforcement
- API versioning and deprecation

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

- **Gateway**: Kong, AWS API Gateway, or custom solution
- **Authentication**: JWT, OAuth 2.0, API keys
- **Rate Limiting**: Redis-based rate limiting
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana
- **Load Balancing**: Round-robin, least connections

## 🔌 API Endpoints
