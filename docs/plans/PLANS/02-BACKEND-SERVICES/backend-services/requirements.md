# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Backend Services specification defines the core server-side infrastructure and APIs that power the Bilten platform. This includes user management, event management, payment processing, notification services, and all supporting microservices. The backend is designed to be scalable, secure, and maintainable while supporting both web and mobile clients with consistent APIs.
