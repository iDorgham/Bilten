# User Authentication Service

## 📋 Overview

The User Authentication Service provides secure authentication and authorization for all Bilten platform users, including event organizers, attendees, and administrators. It handles user registration, login, session management, and role-based access control.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Provide secure user authentication and authorization
- Manage user accounts and profiles
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
- Handle multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Support social login and OAuth integrations

## 🏗️ Architecture Components

### Authentication Engine

- **Features**: JWT token management, password hashing, session handling
- **Use Cases**: User login, token validation, session management

### Authorization System
- **Purpose**: Role-based access control and permissions
- **Features**: Permission management, role assignment, access validation
- **Use Cases**: API access control, feature permissions, admin privileges

### User Management
