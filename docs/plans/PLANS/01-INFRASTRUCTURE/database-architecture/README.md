# Database Architecture Service

## 📋 Overview

The Database Architecture service is responsible for designing, implementing, and maintaining the data storage infrastructure for the Bilten event management platform. This includes the primary PostgreSQL database, analytics database (ClickHouse), and caching layer (Redis).

## 🎯 Purpose

- Design and implement scalable database architecture
- Ensure data integrity and consistency
- Optimize database performance and query efficiency
- Implement data backup and recovery strategies
- Support real-time analytics and reporting

## 🏗️ Architecture Components

### Primary Database (PostgreSQL)
- **Purpose**: Transactional data storage for core business operations
- **Features**: ACID compliance, foreign key constraints, complex queries
- **Use Cases**: User data, event information, payment transactions

### Analytics Database (ClickHouse)
- **Purpose**: High-performance analytics and reporting
- **Features**: Columnar storage, real-time data ingestion, complex aggregations
- **Use Cases**: Event analytics, user behavior tracking, business intelligence

### Cache Layer (Redis)
- **Purpose**: Session storage and performance optimization
- **Features**: In-memory storage, pub/sub messaging, data caching
- **Use Cases**: User sessions, frequently accessed data, real-time features
