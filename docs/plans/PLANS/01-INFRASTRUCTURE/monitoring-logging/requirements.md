# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Monitoring and Logging system provides comprehensive observability, performance monitoring, and operational intelligence for the Bilten platform. This system centralizes log collection, metrics aggregation, distributed tracing, alerting, and incident management across all microservices and infrastructure components, enabling proactive system management, rapid issue resolution, and data-driven operational decisions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want centralized log collection from all services, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor system behavior effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services generate logs THEN the system SHALL collect and centralize them in a searchable format
2. WHEN logs are collected THEN the system SHALL support structured logging with JSON format and metadata
3. WHEN searching logs THEN the system SHALL provide real-time search capabilities with filtering and correlation
4. WHEN logs are stored THEN the system SHALL implement retention policies and efficient storage management

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want real-time metrics and performance monitoring, so that I can ensure optimal system performance and availability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services are running THEN the system SHALL collect CPU, memory, disk, and network metrics
2. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL track application-specific metrics (response times, throughput, errors)
3. WHEN metrics are collected THEN the system SHALL provide real-time dashboards and visualization
4. WHEN performance issues occur THEN the system SHALL detect anomalies and trigger alerts automatically

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want distributed tracing across microservices, so that I can understand request flows and identify performance bottlenecks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requests span multiple services THEN the system SHALL trace the complete request journey
2. WHEN tracing requests THEN the system SHALL capture timing, dependencies, and error information
3. WHEN analyzing traces THEN the system SHALL provide visual representation of service interactions
4. WHEN performance issues occur THEN the system SHALL correlate traces with logs and metrics

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an operations team member, I want intelligent alerting and incident management, so that I can respond quickly to system issues and outages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system issues occur THEN the system SHALL generate alerts based on configurable thresholds and conditions
2. WHEN alerts are triggered THEN the system SHALL support multiple notification channels (email, SMS, Slack, PagerDuty)
3. WHEN incidents happen THEN the system SHALL provide incident tracking and escalation workflows
4. WHEN alerts are resolved THEN the system SHALL automatically close incidents and provide resolution summaries

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want comprehensive system health monitoring, so that I can maintain high availability and prevent service disruptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring system health THEN the system SHALL check service availability, database connectivity, and external dependencies
2. WHEN health checks run THEN the system SHALL provide service status dashboards and uptime tracking
3. WHEN services become unhealthy THEN the system SHALL trigger automatic remediation actions where possible
4. WHEN monitoring infrastructure THEN the system SHALL track resource utilization and capacity planning metrics

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want security event monitoring and audit logging, so that I can detect threats and maintain compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security events occur THEN the system SHALL log authentication attempts, authorization failures, and suspicious activities
2. WHEN monitoring security THEN the system SHALL detect anomalous patterns and potential security threats
3. WHEN audit trails are needed THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive audit logs for compliance reporting
4. WHEN security incidents occur THEN the system SHALL integrate with security information and event management (SIEM) tools

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a business stakeholder, I want operational analytics and reporting, so that I can make informed decisions about system investments and improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing operations THEN the system SHALL provide business-relevant metrics and KPIs
2. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL create automated operational reports and summaries
3. WHEN tracking trends THEN the system SHALL identify patterns in system usage, performance, and costs
4. WHEN planning capacity THEN the system SHALL provide forecasting and resource planning recommendations

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want application performance monitoring (APM), so that I can optimize code performance and user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN applications run THEN the system SHALL monitor code-level performance and database queries
2. WHEN performance issues occur THEN the system SHALL identify slow queries, memory leaks, and bottlenecks
3. WHEN analyzing performance THEN the system SHALL provide code-level insights and optimization recommendations
4. WHEN deploying changes THEN the system SHALL track performance impact and regression detection

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As an infrastructure engineer, I want cost monitoring and optimization insights, so that I can manage cloud expenses and resource efficiency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring costs THEN the system SHALL track cloud resource usage and associated expenses
2. WHEN analyzing efficiency THEN the system SHALL identify underutilized resources and optimization opportunities
3. WHEN costs exceed budgets THEN the system SHALL alert stakeholders and suggest cost reduction measures
4. WHEN planning resources THEN the system SHALL provide cost forecasting and budget planning tools

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want audit trails and data governance monitoring, so that the platform meets regulatory requirements and data protection standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling sensitive data THEN the system SHALL log all data access and modification events
2. WHEN monitoring compliance THEN the system SHALL track GDPR, HIPAA, and other regulatory requirement adherence
3. WHEN auditing systems THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive audit reports and evidence collection
4. WHEN data breaches occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed forensic capabilities and incident documentation
