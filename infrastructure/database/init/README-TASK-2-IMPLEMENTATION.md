## Requirements Satisfied

This implementation satisfies all requirements specified in the task:

**Requirement 2.1:** ✅ Comprehensive data modeling with referential integrity
**Requirement 2.2:** ✅ Zero-downtime migration support and schema versioning
**Requirement 5.2:** ✅ Role-based access controls and data security
**Requirement 6.1:** ✅ Comprehensive audit trails and compliance
**Requirement 8.1:** ✅ Consistent data access patterns and ACID properties
**Requirement 8.2:** ✅ Transaction management and error handling
**Requirement 9.1:** ✅ Automated operations and monitoring support

## Next Steps

The core data models and schemas are now complete. The next recommended steps are:

1. **Task 3:** Implement analytics and reporting infrastructure
2. **Task 4:** Build search and indexing infrastructure  
3. **Task 5:** Establish backup and disaster recovery

All database initialization files are located in `database/init/` and should be executed in numerical order for proper schema setup.
