_**Assistant**_

I'll help you fix these import errors in the ProtectedRoutes.js file. Let me first retrieve any relevant knowledge and then examine the current file structure to understand the issue.

Let me examine the current file structure and the ProtectedRoutes.js file to understand the import issues.


---

Read file: bilten-frontend/src/routes/ProtectedRoutes.js

---

Now let me check the user pages index file to see what's actually exported:


---

Read file: bilten-frontend/src/pages/user/index.js

---

Now let me check where the missing components are located. Let me look at the orders and analytics directories:

Now I understand the issue. The components are located in different directories but the imports in ProtectedRoutes.js are trying to import them all from `../pages/user`. Let me fix the imports:

<details><summary>Edit file: bilten-frontend/src/routes/ProtectedRoutes.js</summary>

I will fix the import statements to import components from their correct locations instead of trying to import them all from the user pages directory.

Now let me store this knowledge for future reference:

*Called tool*: byterover-mcp - byterover-store-knowledge: Store knowledge by extracting programming facts from human-AI interactions. 
    Focus on reusable patterns, implementations, and techniques that provide value beyond common knowledge.

**Extract facts about**: Code patterns, commands, APIs, configurations, error handling, testing, deployment, security, database queries, UI components.
**Essential rules**:
      - PRESERVE complete code/commands in triple backticks exactly as shown
      - Include concise context explaining significance
      - Capture implementation details, not just descriptions
      - Skip trivial or widely-known information
      - Use precise language and avoid ambiguity
      - Keep information relevant to the task at hand
      - Include any relevant error messages or logs
      - Capture any relevant code snippets or examples
      - Include any relevant documentation or references
      - Include any relevant best practices or recommendations

*Parameters*:
  * messages: Fixed import errors in ProtectedRoutes.js by correcting import paths:

1. User components (Wishlist, Profile, Settings, Notifications, MyTickets, TicketDetails) are correctly imported from '../pages/user'
2. Order-related components (Pasket, OrderHistory, OrderDetails, Checkout) are imported from '../pages/orders'
3. Analytics components (Analytics, RealTimeAnalytics) are imported from '../pages/analytics'
4. DataExport component is imported from '../components/DataExport'

The error occurred because the original code was trying to import all components from '../pages/user' when they are actually located in different directories. This is a common issue when components are moved to different directories but import statements are not updated accordingly.

*Result*:
Memory creation has been queued for processing. Estimated time: 25s

Perfect! I've fixed the import errors in the `ProtectedRoutes.js` file. The issue was that the code was trying to import all components from `../pages/user` when they are actually located in different directories:

1. **User components** (Wishlist, Profile, Settings, Notifications, MyTickets, TicketDetails) - correctly imported from `../pages/user`
2. **Order-related components** (Pasket, OrderHistory, OrderDetails, Checkout) - now imported from `../pages/orders`
3. **Analytics components** (Analytics, RealTimeAnalytics) - now imported from `../pages/analytics`
4. **DataExport component** - now imported from `../components/DataExport`

The import statements have been updated to reflect the actual file structure of your project. This should resolve all the export errors you were seeing. The components are now being imported from their correct locations, which matches the directory structure shown in your project layout.
