Now let me examine the current Header component to understand the spacing issue:

Now let me examine the Navbar component more closely to see the current spacing between notifications and toggle switch:


---

Read file: bilten-frontend/src/components/Navbar.js

---

Let me look at the earlier part of the Navbar component where the notifications and toggle switch are defined:


---

Read file: bilten-frontend/src/components/Navbar.js

---

Let me continue reading to see the rest of the notifications section and the spacing:


---

Read file: bilten-frontend/src/components/Navbar.js

---

Now I can see the issue. Looking at the code, I can see that the theme toggle switch and notifications are in the same container with `space-x-3` class, but there might be an issue with the RTL (Right-to-Left) spacing for Arabic. Let me check if there are any specific RTL styles applied and then fix the spacing issue.

Let me also check the current RTL CSS to understand the layout better:


---

Read file: bilten-frontend/src/styles/rtl.css

---

Now I can see the issue. Looking at the Navbar component and the RTL CSS, I can see that the theme toggle switch and notifications are in a container with `space-x-3` class, but there might be an issue with the spacing in RTL mode. Let me examine the specific section where the toggle switch and notifications are positioned and fix the spacing issue.

Based on the image description and the code, I can see that the theme toggle switch and notifications need better spacing in Arabic (RTL) mode. Let me fix this by updating the Navbar component:

Perfect! I've successfully fixed the spacing issue between the notifications and toggle switch in the Header for Arabic (RTL) mode. Here's what I did:

## Changes Made:

### 1. **Updated Navbar Container Spacing**
- Modified the container class from `space-x-3` to `space-x-3 rtl:space-x-reverse rtl:space-x-4`
- This provides better spacing (1rem instead of 0.75rem) specifically in RTL mode
- Added `rtl:space-x-reverse` to ensure proper element ordering

### 2. **Enhanced RTL CSS Rules**
- Added specific CSS rules for the header spacing in Arabic mode
- Ensured proper flex direction and margin adjustments for RTL layout
- Added notifications dropdown positioning for RTL mode

### 3. **Key Improvements**
- **Better Spacing**: Increased spacing from 0.75rem to 1rem in RTL mode
- **Proper Element Ordering**: Ensured correct visual flow in Arabic interface
- **Consistent Layout**: Maintained proper alignment between notifications bell and theme toggle

The fix ensures that when the interface is displayed in Arabic language mode, there will be adequate spacing between the notifications bell icon and the theme toggle switch, providing a better user experience and visual clarity.

The changes are now applied and should resolve the spacing issue you mentioned in the Header for Arabic language mode.
