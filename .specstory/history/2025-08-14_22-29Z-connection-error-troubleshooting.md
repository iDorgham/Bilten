Based on the error you're experiencing, this is a common network connectivity issue with Cursor. Here are several solutions to try:

## Immediate Solutions:

1. **Restart Cursor**
   - Close Cursor completely
   - Wait a few seconds
   - Reopen Cursor

2. **Check Network Connection**
   - Ensure you have a stable internet connection
   - Try switching between WiFi and Ethernet if available
   - Check if your firewall is blocking Cursor

3. **Clear Cursor Cache**
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac)
   - Type "Developer: Reload Window"
   - Press Enter

## Advanced Solutions:

4. **Reset Cursor Settings**
   - Close Cursor
   - Navigate to Cursor's settings directory:
     - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Cursor\User`
     - Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User`
     - Linux: `~/.config/Cursor/User`
   - Rename the `settings.json` file to `settings.json.backup`
   - Restart Cursor

5. **Check Proxy/Firewall Settings**
   - If you're behind a corporate firewall or using a proxy, ensure Cursor has proper access
   - Add Cursor to your firewall's allowed applications list

6. **Update Cursor**
   - Make sure you're using the latest version of Cursor
   - Download the latest version from the official website if needed

## If the Problem Persists:

7. **Reinstall Cursor**
   - Uninstall Cursor completely
   - Delete any remaining Cursor folders
   - Download and install the latest version

8. **Check System Resources**
   - Ensure you have sufficient RAM and disk space
   - Close other resource-intensive applications

The error `ECONNRESET` typically indicates that the connection was forcibly closed by the remote server or network equipment. This is often temporary and resolves with a simple restart.
