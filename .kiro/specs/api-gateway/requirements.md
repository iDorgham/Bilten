# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The API Gateway is the central entry point for all client requests to the Bilten platform, providing unified access to microservices, authentication, rate limiting, request routing, and comprehensive API management. This gateway ensures secure, scalable, and efficient communication between frontend applications, mobile apps, and backend services while providing monitoring, analytics, and developer-friendly API experiences.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want a unified API endpoint, so that I can access all platform services through a single, consistent interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clients make API requests THEN the gateway SHALL route them to appropriate backend services
2. WHEN services are updated THEN the gateway SHALL maintain API versioning and backward compatibility
3. WHEN multiple services are needed THEN the gateway SHALL support request aggregation and composition
4. WHEN API responses are returned THEN the gateway SHALL provide consistent response formats across all services

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to control API access and usage, so that I can prevent abuse and ensure fair resource allocation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clients exceed rate limits THEN the gateway SHALL throttle requests and return appropriate error messages
2. WHEN monitoring API usage THEN the gateway SHALL track requests per user, organization, and API endpoint
3. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN the gateway SHALL implement automatic blocking and alerting
4. WHEN managing access THEN the gateway SHALL support IP whitelisting, blacklisting, and geographic restrictions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security officer, I want centralized authentication and authorization, so that all API access is properly secured and audited.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clients access protected endpoints THEN the gateway SHALL validate authentication tokens
2. WHEN checking permissions THEN the gateway SHALL enforce role-based access control (RBAC)
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the gateway SHALL return standardized error responses
4. WHEN security events occur THEN the gateway SHALL log all authentication and authorization attempts

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a mobile app developer, I want optimized API responses, so that mobile users have fast and efficient experiences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN mobile clients make requests THEN the gateway SHALL provide response compression and optimization
2. WHEN serving mobile apps THEN the gateway SHALL support field selection and response filtering
3. WHEN handling mobile requests THEN the gateway SHALL implement intelligent caching strategies
4. WHEN network conditions vary THEN the gateway SHALL adapt response sizes and formats accordingly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want comprehensive monitoring and observability, so that I can maintain system health and performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing requests THEN the gateway SHALL collect detailed metrics on latency, throughput, and errors
2. WHEN system issues occur THEN the gateway SHALL provide distributed tracing and request correlation
3. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the gateway SHALL track service health and availability
4. WHEN analyzing usage THEN the gateway SHALL provide comprehensive analytics and reporting dashboards

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want service discovery and load balancing, so that services can scale dynamically without manual configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services register THEN the gateway SHALL automatically discover and route to healthy instances
2. WHEN services scale THEN the gateway SHALL distribute load evenly across available instances
3. WHEN services fail THEN the gateway SHALL implement circuit breakers and failover mechanisms
4. WHEN deploying updates THEN the gateway SHALL support blue-green deployments and canary releases

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want comprehensive documentation and testing tools, so that I can efficiently integrate with the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing API documentation THEN the gateway SHALL provide interactive OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
2. WHEN testing APIs THEN the gateway SHALL offer built-in testing and sandbox environments
3. WHEN integrating services THEN the gateway SHALL provide SDK generation and code examples
4. WHEN debugging issues THEN the gateway SHALL offer request/response inspection and debugging tools

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to manage API versions and deprecation, so that I can evolve the platform while maintaining compatibility.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN releasing new API versions THEN the gateway SHALL support multiple concurrent versions
2. WHEN deprecating APIs THEN the gateway SHALL provide clear migration paths and timelines
3. WHEN managing versions THEN the gateway SHALL route requests based on version headers or URL paths
4. WHEN communicating changes THEN the gateway SHALL notify developers of version updates and deprecations

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want audit trails and data governance, so that API usage complies with regulatory requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing requests THEN the gateway SHALL maintain comprehensive audit logs
2. WHEN handling sensitive data THEN the gateway SHALL implement data masking and privacy controls
3. WHEN required by regulations THEN the gateway SHALL support data residency and geographic routing
4. WHEN auditing access THEN the gateway SHALL provide detailed compliance reporting and data lineage

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a third-party developer, I want secure API access with proper authentication, so that I can build integrations with the Bilten platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN third parties request access THEN the gateway SHALL provide API key management and OAuth 2.0 flows
2. WHEN managing developer access THEN the gateway SHALL offer self-service developer portals
3. WHEN monitoring third-party usage THEN the gateway SHALL provide usage analytics and billing integration
4. WHEN securing integrations THEN the gateway SHALL implement webhook validation and secure callback mechanisms
