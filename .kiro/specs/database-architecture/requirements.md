# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Database Architecture specification defines the comprehensive data storage, management, and access patterns for the Bilten platform.

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security officer, I want comprehensive data security and access controls, so that sensitive data is protected from unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing sensitive data THEN the system SHALL implement encryption at rest and in transit
2. WHEN accessing data THEN the system SHALL enforce role-based access controls
3. WHEN auditing access THEN the system SHALL log all data access and modifications
4. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL detect and alert on suspicious activities
5. WHEN handling PII THEN the system SHALL implement data masking and tokenization
6. WHEN complying with regulations THEN the system SHALL support GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy laws

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want comprehensive audit trails and data lineage, so that all data operations can be tracked and audited.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data changes THEN the system SHALL maintain complete audit trails with timestamps
2. WHEN tracking lineage THEN the system SHALL document data flow and transformations
3. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide compliance and audit reports
4. IF audits are required THEN the system SHALL provide immutable audit logs
5. WHEN investigating issues THEN the system SHALL provide detailed transaction histories
6. WHEN retaining data THEN the system SHALL enforce data retention policies automatically

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want efficient analytics and reporting capabilities, so that business intelligence queries can be executed without impacting operational systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running analytics THEN the system SHALL use dedicated analytical databases
2. WHEN processing large datasets THEN the system SHALL support columnar storage and compression
3. WHEN executing complex queries THEN the system SHALL provide parallel query processing
4. IF analytical workloads increase THEN the system SHALL scale analytical resources independently
5. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL support real-time and batch processing
6. WHEN integrating data THEN the system SHALL provide ETL/ELT pipelines for data warehousing

### Requirement 8
