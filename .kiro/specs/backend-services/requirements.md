# Bilten Backend Services - Requirements

## Introduction

The Bilten Backend Services provide the core API infrastructure and business logic for the entire Bilten platform. These services handle user management, event management, payment processing, and all other core platform functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: API Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust API endpoints for the Bilten platform, so that frontend applications can interact with the system reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client makes an API request THEN the system SHALL respond with appropriate HTTP status codes
2. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN the system SHALL validate input parameters and return structured responses
3. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL verify JWT tokens and authorize requests
4. IF an API error occurs THEN the system SHALL return detailed error information

### Requirement 2: User Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive user management capabilities in Bilten, so that I can manage user accounts and permissions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user registers THEN the system SHALL create a user account with appropriate default settings
2. WHEN user information is updated THEN the system SHALL validate and persist the changes
3. WHEN user roles are assigned THEN the system SHALL update permissions accordingly
4. WHEN a user is deactivated THEN the system SHALL restrict access while preserving data

### Requirement 3: Event Management

**User Story:** As an event organizer, I want to create and manage events through Bilten APIs, so that I can offer events to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an organizer creates an event THEN the system SHALL validate event data and store it
2. WHEN event details are updated THEN the system SHALL apply changes and notify relevant systems
3. WHEN events are published THEN the system SHALL make them available for discovery
4. WHEN events are cancelled THEN the system SHALL handle refunds and notifications

### Requirement 4: Integration Capabilities

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want Bilten to integrate with external services, so that the platform can leverage third-party capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN payment processing is required THEN the system SHALL integrate with payment gateways
2. WHEN notifications need to be sent THEN the system SHALL use appropriate messaging services
3. WHEN file storage is needed THEN the system SHALL integrate with cloud storage providers
4. WHEN external APIs are called THEN the system SHALL handle errors and retries appropriately
