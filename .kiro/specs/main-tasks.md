## Implementation Guidelines
1. **Complete phases sequentially** - Don't start Phase N+1 until Phase N is 100% complete
2. **Test continuously** - Each task should include testing as part of completion
3. **Document as you go** - Update documentation with each completed task
4. **Review regularly** - Weekly phase progress reviews recommended
5. **Maintain quality** - Code reviews and quality gates at each phase boundary
