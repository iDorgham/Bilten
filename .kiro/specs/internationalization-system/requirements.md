# Internationalization System Enhancement - Requirements

## Introduction

The Bilten platform currently has a basic internationalization system with embedded translations in the LanguageContext. This enhancement will improve the translation management system, add dedicated language management pages, expand language support, and provide better tools for managing translations across the platform.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Translation Management System

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to manage translations through a dedicated interface, so that I can easily add, edit, and maintain translations without touching code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin accesses the translation management page THEN the system SHALL display all available languages and their translation status
2. WHEN an admin selects a language THEN the system SHALL show all translation keys and their values for that language
3. WHEN an admin edits a translation THEN the system SHALL update the translation and mark it as modified
4. WHEN an admin adds a new translation key THEN the system SHALL create the key across all supported languages
5. IF a translation is missing THEN the system SHALL highlight it as incomplete and show the fallback text

### Requirement 2: Language Configuration Pages

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to configure language settings and add new languages, so that I can expand the platform's international reach.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin accesses the language settings page THEN the system SHALL display all configured languages with their status
2. WHEN an admin enables/disables a language THEN the system SHALL update the language availability for users
3. WHEN an admin adds a new language THEN the system SHALL create the language configuration and initialize empty translations
4. WHEN an admin sets a default language THEN the system SHALL use it as the fallback for missing translations
5. IF a language has incomplete translations THEN the system SHALL show the completion percentage

### Requirement 3: Translation File Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want translations stored in separate JSON files, so that I can manage translations more efficiently and enable better collaboration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system loads THEN it SHALL read translations from separate JSON files for each language
2. WHEN a translation is updated THEN the system SHALL save changes to the appropriate JSON file
3. WHEN a new language is added THEN the system SHALL create a new JSON file with the language structure
4. WHEN translations are exported THEN the system SHALL generate downloadable JSON files
5. IF a translation file is corrupted THEN the system SHALL fall back to the default language

### Requirement 4: Advanced Language Features

**User Story:** As a user, I want enhanced language support including pluralization, date formatting, and currency display, so that I have a fully localized experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying numbers THEN the system SHALL format them according to the selected language locale
2. WHEN displaying dates THEN the system SHALL use the appropriate date format for the language
3. WHEN displaying currency THEN the system SHALL show amounts in the appropriate format and symbol
4. WHEN using pluralization THEN the system SHALL select the correct plural form based on language rules
5. IF RTL language is selected THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate RTL styling and layout

### Requirement 5: Translation Import/Export System

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want to import and export translations in standard formats, so that I can work with external translation services and tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exporting translations THEN the system SHALL generate files in CSV, JSON, and XLIFF formats
2. WHEN importing translations THEN the system SHALL validate and merge the imported data
3. WHEN importing partial translations THEN the system SHALL update only the provided keys
4. WHEN there are import conflicts THEN the system SHALL show a preview and allow conflict resolution
5. IF import validation fails THEN the system SHALL show detailed error messages

### Requirement 6: Translation Validation and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a quality assurance manager, I want to validate translations for completeness and consistency, so that I can ensure high-quality localization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running translation validation THEN the system SHALL identify missing translations across all languages
2. WHEN checking translation consistency THEN the system SHALL flag potential issues like mismatched placeholders
3. WHEN reviewing translations THEN the system SHALL show usage statistics and context information
4. WHEN translations are incomplete THEN the system SHALL generate reports showing completion status
5. IF critical translations are missing THEN the system SHALL prevent language activation

### Requirement 7: User Language Preferences

**User Story:** As a user, I want to set my language preference and have it remembered across sessions, so that I don't need to change it every time I visit.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a language THEN the system SHALL save the preference to their profile
2. WHEN a user returns to the site THEN the system SHALL load their preferred language automatically
3. WHEN a guest user selects a language THEN the system SHALL remember it in browser storage
4. WHEN a user's preferred language is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to the default language
5. IF browser language detection is enabled THEN the system SHALL suggest the user's browser language on first visit
