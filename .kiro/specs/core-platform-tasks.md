## Dependencies and Integration Points

1. **Database Layer** → All services depend on core database infrastructure
2. **Authentication Service** → Required by all user-facing applications
3. **API Gateway** → Central routing point for all service communication
4. **File Storage** → Required by frontend, admin panel, and mobile app
5. **Payment Processing** → Core to business functionality
6. **Notification System** → Integrates with all user-facing features
7. **Analytics** → Depends on data from all other services

## Risk Mitigation

- **Technical Debt**: Regular code reviews and refactoring sprints
