# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The User Authentication Service is a comprehensive identity and access management system that handles user registration, authentication, authorization, and profile management for the Bilten platform. This service provides secure, scalable, and user-friendly authentication mechanisms including multi-factor authentication, social login, biometric authentication, and enterprise SSO integration while ensuring compliance with security standards and privacy regulations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to register for an account using email or social media, so that I can access the Bilten platform quickly and securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers with email THEN the system SHALL require email verification before account activation
2. WHEN a user registers with social media THEN the system SHALL support Google, Facebook, Apple, and LinkedIn OAuth
3. WHEN registration occurs THEN the system SHALL validate email uniqueness and password strength requirements
4. WHEN account creation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and guidance for resolution

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a returning user, I want to log in securely using multiple authentication methods, so that I can access my account conveniently and safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users log in THEN the system SHALL support email/password, social login, and biometric authentication
2. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL generate secure JWT tokens with appropriate expiration
3. WHEN login attempts fail THEN the system SHALL implement progressive delays and account lockout protection
4. WHEN users are inactive THEN the system SHALL automatically expire sessions and require re-authentication

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want to enable multi-factor authentication, so that my account has additional protection against unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users enable MFA THEN the system SHALL support TOTP apps, SMS, and email-based verification
2. WHEN MFA is configured THEN the system SHALL require second factor for all subsequent logins
3. WHEN MFA codes are invalid THEN the system SHALL provide backup recovery codes for account access
4. WHEN MFA is enabled THEN the system SHALL allow users to manage and update their MFA settings

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to use biometric authentication, so that I can access my account quickly without typing passwords.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN mobile devices support biometrics THEN the system SHALL enable fingerprint and face recognition login
2. WHEN biometric authentication is used THEN the system SHALL store biometric templates securely on device only
3. WHEN biometric authentication fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to traditional authentication methods
4. WHEN users disable biometrics THEN the system SHALL remove all biometric data and revert to password authentication

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an enterprise user, I want to use single sign-on (SSO), so that I can access Bilten using my corporate credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizations configure SSO THEN the system SHALL support SAML 2.0 and OpenID Connect protocols
2. WHEN users authenticate via SSO THEN the system SHALL automatically provision accounts and assign appropriate roles
3. WHEN SSO sessions expire THEN the system SHALL redirect users to their identity provider for re-authentication
4. WHEN SSO is configured THEN the system SHALL support just-in-time (JIT) user provisioning and attribute mapping

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my profile and privacy settings, so that I can control my personal information and account preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access profile settings THEN the system SHALL allow updating personal information, preferences, and privacy controls
2. WHEN users change passwords THEN the system SHALL require current password verification and enforce strength requirements
3. WHEN users update email addresses THEN the system SHALL require verification of the new email before activation
4. WHEN users request account deletion THEN the system SHALL provide data export options and comply with GDPR requirements

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user who forgot my password, I want to reset it securely, so that I can regain access to my account without compromising security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users request password reset THEN the system SHALL send secure reset links via email with time-limited validity
2. WHEN reset links are used THEN the system SHALL require strong password creation and invalidate all existing sessions
3. WHEN multiple reset attempts occur THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
4. WHEN password reset completes THEN the system SHALL notify users via email and log the security event

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor authentication events and security incidents, so that I can maintain platform security and compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication events occur THEN the system SHALL log all login attempts, failures, and security events
2. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL automatically flag accounts and alert administrators
3. WHEN monitoring user activity THEN the system SHALL track login patterns, device usage, and geographic access
4. WHEN security incidents occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed audit trails and forensic information

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want authentication to meet regulatory requirements, so that the platform complies with data protection and security standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling user data THEN the system SHALL comply with GDPR, CCPA, and other applicable privacy regulations
2. WHEN storing authentication data THEN the system SHALL use industry-standard encryption and security practices
3. WHEN users request data access THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive data export and deletion capabilities
4. WHEN auditing compliance THEN the system SHALL maintain detailed logs and provide compliance reporting

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate authentication via APIs, so that other services can verify user identity and permissions programmatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services need authentication THEN the system SHALL provide RESTful APIs for token validation and user information
2. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL support service-to-service authentication with API keys or certificates
3. WHEN tokens are validated THEN the system SHALL return user identity, roles, and permissions information
4. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error codes and messages for debugging
