## Task Dependencies

### Critical Path:
1. Project Setup (1.1-1.3) → Database Setup (2.1-2.2) → Models (2.3) → Authentication (3.1-3.2) → API Endpoints (4.1-4.3) → Integration (8.1-8.3)

### Parallel Development:
- File Storage (5.1-5.4) can be developed in parallel with API endpoints
- Testing (6.1-6.4) should be implemented alongside each feature
- Documentation (7.1-7.2) can be created as features are completed

## Completion Criteria

### Phase Complete When:
- [ ] All database migrations run successfully and create proper schema
- [ ] Authentication system works with JWT tokens and role-based access
- [ ] All core API endpoints return data in expected format
- [ ] File upload and storage system handles images properly
- [ ] Frontend successfully connects to backend and displays real data
- [ ] Test coverage exceeds 80% for all core functionality
- [ ] API documentation is complete and accessible

## Implementation Notes

1. **Database First**: Complete database setup before building API endpoints
2. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests alongside implementation, not after
3. **Security Focus**: Implement proper validation and security from the start
4. **Frontend Compatibility**: Ensure API responses match existing frontend expectations
5. **Environment Parity**: Keep development and production configurations consistent
