# Backend Foundation Requirements

## Introduction

This specification covers the implementation of the core backend infrastructure for the Bilten event management platform. This includes database architecture, backend services foundation, and file storage service - the essential components that all other features depend on.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Database Architecture

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a robust database architecture that can handle all event management data efficiently, so that the platform can scale and perform well under load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN the database SHALL be automatically initialized with proper schema
2. WHEN data is stored THEN the database SHALL enforce referential integrity and constraints
3. WHEN queries are executed THEN the database SHALL provide optimal performance through proper indexing
4. WHEN the system scales THEN the database SHALL support connection pooling and optimization
5. WHEN data needs to be migrated THEN the system SHALL provide migration tools and version control
6. WHEN data needs to be backed up THEN the system SHALL provide automated backup and recovery procedures

### Requirement 2: Backend Services Foundation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-structured backend API framework that provides authentication, security, and core services, so that I can build features efficiently and securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts THEN the API framework SHALL be available and responsive
2. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL authenticate and authorize users properly
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully and provide meaningful responses
4. WHEN requests are processed THEN the system SHALL log activities and validate input data
5. WHEN the API is accessed THEN the system SHALL enforce CORS and security policies
6. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL support environment-based configuration management

### Requirement 3: File Storage Service

**User Story:** As an event organizer, I want to upload and manage event images and documents securely, so that I can showcase my events with rich media content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL validate file types, sizes, and security
2. WHEN files are stored THEN the system SHALL use cloud storage with CDN integration
3. WHEN files are accessed THEN the system SHALL provide fast delivery through optimized URLs
4. WHEN files are managed THEN the system SHALL track metadata and provide indexing
5. WHEN files are processed THEN the system SHALL scan for viruses and malware
6. WHEN files are deleted THEN the system SHALL clean up storage and update references

### Requirement 4: API Integration Layer

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want consistent API endpoints that integrate seamlessly with the existing frontend, so that the transition from mock to real data is smooth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN they SHALL match the existing mock API structure
2. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL use JWT tokens consistently
3. WHEN data is returned THEN the response format SHALL match frontend expectations
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the error format SHALL be consistent with current error handling
5. WHEN the backend is unavailable THEN the frontend SHALL gracefully fallback to mock data

### Requirement 5: Development and Testing Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper development tools and testing infrastructure, so that I can develop, test, and debug the backend efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing locally THEN the system SHALL provide hot reload and debugging capabilities
2. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive test coverage and reporting
3. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL support different environments (dev, staging, production)
4. WHEN monitoring THEN the system SHALL provide health checks and performance metrics
5. WHEN debugging THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logging and error tracking
