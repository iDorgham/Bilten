## Testing Approach

### Test Pyramid
```
                    /\
                   /  \
                  / E2E \
                 /______\
                /        \
               /Integration\
              /__________\
             /            \
            /     Unit      \
           /________________\
```

- **Unit Tests (70%)**: Fast, isolated component testing
- **Integration Tests (20%)**: Service interaction testing
- **End-to-End Tests (10%)**: Complete user journey validation

### Quality Standards
- **Code Coverage**: Minimum 80% for critical paths
- **Test Automation**: 90% of regression tests automated
- **Performance**: 95th percentile response time < 500ms
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Security**: Regular security testing and vulnerability assessments

## Testing Tools and Frameworks

### Frontend Testing
- **Unit Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright, Cypress
- **Visual Testing**: Chromatic, Percy
- **Performance**: Lighthouse, WebPageTest

### Backend Testing
- **Unit Testing**: Jest, Mocha
- **Integration Testing**: Supertest, Testcontainers
- **API Testing**: Postman, Newman
- **Load Testing**: Artillery, k6

### Mobile Testing
- **Native Testing**: Appium, Detox
- **Responsive Testing**: BrowserStack, Sauce Labs
- **Performance**: Mobile-specific performance testing

## Quality Metrics

### Test Metrics
- **Test Coverage**: Code and feature coverage tracking
- **Test Execution**: Pass rates, execution time, flaky test rates
- **Defect Metrics**: Bug discovery rate, resolution time, escape rate
- **Performance Metrics**: Response times, throughput, error rates

### Quality Gates
- **Code Review**: Mandatory peer review for all changes
- **Automated Testing**: All tests must pass before deployment
- **Performance Testing**: Performance benchmarks must be met
- **Security Scanning**: Security vulnerabilities must be addressed

## Continuous Improvement

### Regular Activities
- **Test Review**: Quarterly review of test effectiveness
- **Process Improvement**: Monthly retrospectives and improvements
- **Tool Evaluation**: Regular assessment of testing tools and frameworks
- **Training**: Ongoing training on testing best practices

### Quality Culture
- **Shift Left**: Early testing in development cycle
- **Everyone Tests**: Quality is everyone's responsibility
- **Continuous Learning**: Regular knowledge sharing and training
- **Data-Driven**: Decisions based on quality metrics and data
