## 📁 **File Upload System Architecture**

### **Upload Flow**
1. **User Authentication** - JWT token required for all upload operations
2. **File Validation** - Check file type, size, and format
3. **File Processing** - Generate unique filename and organize by folder
4. **Storage** - Save to local storage (mock) or S3 (production)
5. **Database Update** - Update user profile or event with new image URL
6. **File Access** - Provide URL for file retrieval
7. **File Deletion** - Remove old files when replaced

### **API Endpoints**

#### **Mock Upload Endpoints (Development)**
- `POST /v1/uploads-mock/profile-image` - Upload user profile image
- `POST /v1/uploads-mock/event-image` - Upload event cover image (organizer/admin only)
- `GET /v1/uploads-mock/mock/:folder/:subfolder/:filename` - Serve uploaded files
- `DELETE /v1/uploads-mock/delete` - Delete uploaded file

#### **Production Upload Endpoints (S3)**
- `POST /v1/uploads/profile-image` - Upload user profile image
- `POST /v1/uploads/event-image` - Upload event cover image (organizer/admin only)
- `POST /v1/uploads/event-gallery` - Upload multiple event images
- `DELETE /v1/uploads/delete` - Delete uploaded file

2. Set up CloudFront CDN for file delivery
3. Implement file compression and optimization
4. Add image resizing and thumbnail generation
5. Set up upload monitoring and analytics

**Status**: ✅ **FILE UPLOAD SYSTEM READY FOR PRODUCTION**

## 🔍 **Known Issues**

### **Mock Route Deletion Issue**
- **Issue**: DELETE `/v1/uploads-mock/delete` route returns 500 error
- **Status**: Delete function works correctly, route issue to be investigated
- **Workaround**: Use direct file system deletion for development
- **Impact**: Low - core upload functionality unaffected

### **Resolution Plan**
1. Debug route mounting and middleware
2. Check request body parsing
3. Verify authentication middleware
4. Test with different HTTP clients
