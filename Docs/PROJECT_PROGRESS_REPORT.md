# ðŸ“ˆ Project Progress Report

## Overview
Bilten is an event management and ticketing platform consisting of a Node.js backend, a React frontend, and a scanner PWA. Core infrastructure runs locally via Docker Compose (PostgreSQL, Redis, optional MySQL/MongoDB for testing tools) with documented environment configuration.

## Current Status
- âœ… Backend API scaffold present with routes for auth, events, tickets, orders, analytics
- âœ… Frontend app structured by feature folders with admin, events, auth, analytics pages
- âœ… Scanner PWA with QR validation components
- âœ… Docker Compose services for PostgreSQL, Redis, admin tools, and all apps
- âœ… Environment configuration guides and real API wiring docs
- ðŸ”„ Testing and CI/CD work planned; performance and security hardening pending

## Local Infrastructure
- Use Docker Compose to bring up dependencies and apps:
  - `docker compose up -d` (Compose V2) or `docker-compose up -d`
- Databases available: PostgreSQL (primary), Redis; pgAdmin and phpMyAdmin provided for convenience
- App endpoints: frontend `:3000`, backend `:3001`, scanner `:3002`

## Windows WSL2 + Docker Desktop
Run Docker from Ubuntu WSL with Docker Desktop engine:
1) Docker Desktop â†’ Settings â†’ Resources â†’ WSL Integration â†’ enable for Ubuntu
2) Verify in PowerShell: `wsl -l -v` (Ubuntu must be VERSION 2)
3) From Ubuntu shell:
   - `docker version` and `docker run hello-world`
   - `cd /mnt/d/Work/AI/Projects/Bilten && docker compose up -d`
Performance tip: for heavy file I/O, clone the repo inside Linux filesystem (e.g., `~/work/Bilten`) instead of `/mnt/d/*`.

## Recent Work
- **Admin Dashboard & Layout Issues Completely Resolved**: Fixed critical routing and layout conflicts that were preventing admin pages from rendering. All admin pages now work properly with full AdminLayout (sidebar, header, content).
- **React Router Nested Routing Fix**: Corrected nested route paths in ProtectedRoutes from `/admin/dashboard` to `/dashboard` to work properly with React Router's path stripping behavior.
- **Export API Implementation**: Created complete backend `/export/*` endpoints for Data Export Center functionality with types, preview, scheduled exports, and history.
- **CSP Configuration Fix**: Updated Content Security Policy to allow localhost:3001 connections for local development, resolving API connection blocks.
- **App.js Layout Structure Fix**: Separated admin layout from regular layout to prevent conflicts between AdminLayout (sidebar/header) and standard layout (navbar/footer).
- **API Connection Issue Resolution**: Fixed persistent "API Error: Connection failed" by updating ApiStatusIndicator component to use correct API configuration instead of hardcoded URL
- **Admin Dashboard Rebuild**: Completely redesigned admin dashboard with comprehensive metrics, real-time activity feed, system health monitoring, and modern glass morphism design
- **Password Reset Implementation**: Added complete password reset functionality to backend with JWT-based tokens, frontend UI components, and comprehensive documentation
- **Articles API**: Created missing `/api/v1/articles` endpoints to fix news page functionality
- **Documentation updates**: added WSL + Docker usage, clarified Compose commands, reinforced env setup paths
- **Local run verification**: containers up, services reachable (HTTP 200)

### Run Results (Local, Docker Compose)
- Backend health: http://localhost:3001/health â†’ 200
- Frontend root: http://localhost:3000 â†’ 200
- Scanner root: http://localhost:3002 â†’ 200
- Consolidated quick start steps across README and environment docs

### Test Coverage Progress (Frontend)
- Added unit tests:
  - `src/utils/slugUtils.js`
  - `src/styles/utilities.js`
  - `src/styles/theme.js`
  - `src/routes/ProtectedRoutes.js` and `src/routes/index.js` helpers (mocked)
  - Hooks: `useBasket.js`, `useNotifications.js`, `useWishlist.js`
  - Components: `LanguageDropdown.js`, `SocialButton.js`, `ThemeToggle.js`
- Current snapshot (approx.):
  - Overall: ~10% lines, ~10% statements
  - Styles: ~98% lines (utilities, theme)
  - Hooks: `useBasket` ~81%, `useNotifications` ~83%, `useWishlist` ~55%
  - Routes: helpers covered via mocks
  - App warnings: React act() warnings present but do not fail tests

### Test Coverage Progress (Backend)
- Added route tests:
  - `GET /api/v1` metadata
  - `events`: list, get by id (200/404), create
  - `tickets`: list by event, get by id (200/404), validate (not found/valid/already used)
  - `auth`: login (validation/unknown/valid admin), register (validation/ok)
  - `users`: profile get/put
- Current snapshot (approx.):
  - Overall backend: ~86% lines, ~86% statements
  - Routes: 90â€“100% covered across files
  - `server.js`: ~74% lines (uncovered: sendFile path and some error/404 branches)

### Security Hardening
- Backend hardening applied:
  - Helmet tightened (CSP varies by env), disabled x-powered-by, trust proxy
  - CORS allowlist via `CORS_ORIGIN` env (comma-separated)
  - HPP to prevent parameter pollution
  - Global rate limit plus auth-specific throttle (slow-down + stricter limiter)
  - Stronger input validation and XSS sanitization on auth endpoints
- Frontend security headers:
  - Strict CSP meta tag in `public/index.html` with `connect-src` for API and Stripe
  - CSP violation reporting to `/api/v1/security/csp-report`
  - Nginx reverse proxy header guidance in README.md

## Next Tasks
- [ ] Tests: fix configuration, increase coverage toward 80%
- [x] CI: minimal GitHub Actions workflow for Node tests and coverage artifacts (added)
- [x] Coverage reporting: Codecov upload from CI (frontend/backend LCOV)
- [x] CI/CD: pipeline for build, test, lint, and container images
- [x] Security: audit auth, input validation, and headers
- [ ] Performance: profiling, DB indexes, caching strategy
- [ ] Monitoring: dashboards and alerts (New Relic)
