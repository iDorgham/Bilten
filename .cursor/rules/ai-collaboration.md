AI collaboration (Cursor)

Usage
- Provide clear goals and constraints in requests.
- Reference files with paths (e.g., `src/routes/events.js`).
- Prefer diffs/edits over large code dumps.

Workspace rules
- Always retrieve related context before tasks and store critical info after successful tasks (ByteRover knowledge base).

Style
- Ask for minimal confirmations; proceed when unblocked.
- Keep messages skimmable; format only relevant code or data.
